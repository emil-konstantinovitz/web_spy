Browser plugin that will listen to all configured event types
originating from your interactions, written for totalitarian regimes
and browser automation and testing.

The raw event data is easily redirected to a native appliaction listener
or simply a file. The events are quite easy to replay in the browser
and hence this serves as a very barebones basis for developing
browser automation solutions.
